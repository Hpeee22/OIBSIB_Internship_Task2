        <h2>Early-Life:</h2>
        <p class="content">APJ Abdul Kalam was born into a poor Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, on October 15, 1931. 
            His mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife and his father, Jainulabdeen, was an imam of a local mosque and a boat owner. 
            He was the youngest in the family with four elder brothers and a sister.
           Though, the family was not financially affluent yet all the children were raised in an atmosphere that was full of love and compassion.
            In order to add to the family’s income, Kalam had to sell newspapers during his early years.
            He was an average student during his school, but possessed a strong desire to learn and was very hard working. 
            He loved mathematics and spent hours studying the subject. He pursued his education from ‘Schwartz Higher Secondary School,’ and then graduated from ‘Saint Joseph’s College, Tiruchirappalli,’ in 1954.
             He wanted to become a fighter pilot but his dream could not be fulfilled as here were only eight positions available in the IAF and he secured the ninth place.

            In 1960, he graduated from the ‘Madras Institute of Technology,’ and joined as a scientist at the ‘Aeronautical Development Establishment,’ after becoming a member of the ‘Defence Research and Development Service.’ Kalam also worked under the eminent space scientist Vikram Sarabhai while he was a part of ‘INCOSPAR’ committee. Kalam was transferred to the ‘Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)’ in 1969. He became the project head of the country’s foremost Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III). In July 1980, SLV-III deployed the ‘Rohini’ satellite successfully near-earth orbit under Kalam’s leadership.

            Kalam was a part of a number of projects, including ‘Project Devil,’ in 1970. Though the project was not successful, yet it laid the foundation for the development of the ‘Prithvi Missile,’ in 1980. He was also associated with ‘Project Valiant.’

            In 1983, Kalam returned to DRDO as its chief as he was asked to lead the ‘Integrated Guided Missile Development Program’ (IGMDP).

            In May 1998, he played a key role in carrying out ‘Porkhran-II’ nuclear tests by India. The success of these nuclear tests made Kalam a national hero and his popularity went skyrocketing.

            As a technical visionary, he made several recommendations in the fields of technological innovations, agriculture, and nuclear energy to make India a developed nation by 2020.
